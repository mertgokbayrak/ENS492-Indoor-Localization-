# Indoor Localization Using Camera Images

## Project Overview

Indoor localization has been a significant challenge in the realm of autonomous navigation, especially within environments where GPS and other outdoor localization techniques falter. This project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the power of camera images and deep learning. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically focusing on the YOLO algorithm, we strive to develop a reliable indoor localization system for mobile robots, enhancing their autonomy and effectiveness in dynamic, indoor settings.
